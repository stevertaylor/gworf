Welcome! This lightweight package is designed to allow you to rapidly compute the overlap reduction functions for gravitational-wave detectors. It is currently built for pulsar-timing arrays, but I foresee easy expansion. 

## Installation

You have a few options.

* Click on the binder button above to be directed to a self-contained binder image of this repository.
* Use the `yaml` file in this repo to install a conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
* Use pip: `pip install git+https://github.com/stevertaylor/gworf`

## Usage

Follow the examples in the [demo](https://github.com/stevertaylor/gworf/blob/master/demo/demo.ipynb) notebook.
